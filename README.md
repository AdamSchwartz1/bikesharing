## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride share data from New York City and put together a presentation in Tableau to present the findings to an investor to gain their support.

Applications: Tableau, Python, and Jupyter Notebook

## Results
There is a description for each of the visulations listed in the Tableau story.

## Summary
There were several things that stood out to me while doing this analysis. First, the majority of people who used the NYC service were males and were subscribed to the service. It would be good to create an incentive for one time users to subscribe to this program in hopes of making them use it more. Second, the majority of the rides lasted for less than 40 minutes with the peak ride duration being at 5 minutes. Lastly was that there were certain times of each day that were clearly the most popular times to ride. On weekends, it was late morning/afternoon and on weekdays it ws the morning and afternoon commute times.

### Additional Visualizations
1. I would create a graph showing which percent of men, woman, and unknown were subscribers or basic customers. We graphed those individually but not together.
2. I would also create to see which age groups are taking the most rides. It would help figure out what the target audience should be when it's started in Iowa.
